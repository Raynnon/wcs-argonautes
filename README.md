There are 2 directories. You need to start both of them to be able to visualize the application.

### App directory for the front:

#### Create a .env in the root (You can use the .env.example to do it)

#### `npm install`

#### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Server directory for the API:

#### Create a .env in the root (You can use the .env.example to do it). Be carefull you can use the current `MONGODB_PATH` but do it knowing the risk!
